Our Juno solution will deliver what NEAR creators and developers crave, highly configurable minting and storefront tools to deploy stores and minting facilities on their own domains without the need to use 3rd party tools like https://www.mintbase.io/ and https://paras.id/. Helping them establish their own NFT brands on their terms in a highly competitive market. Juno will be in the same vein as the Solana powered Metaplex protocol and its Candy Machine minting tool, which has minted 2.2Mil NFTS in 3 months.
