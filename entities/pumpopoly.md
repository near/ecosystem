"Pumpopoly features classic board game gameplay combined with the latest NFT technology. Easy to play and understand. Complete the built in tutorial, consult FAQ or get help on our dedicated support Discord.

Pumpopoly is a casual pixel art game playable on all platforms. Play Pumpopoly on your mobile phone or desktop browser. Try Pumpopoly for free with no obligation on the NEAR testnet.

Pumpopoly's viral game mechanics reward you for sharing. Earn 50% commissions when your invites buy public land. Level up your in-game credit score by sharing with friends or buying property. Users with qualifying in-game credit scores can upgrade their property by building one of four structures: hovels, small townhouses, townhouses or towers.

All players can claim an hourly salary from the salary by simply driving along Pumpopolis Place. Players pay rent while parked at properties owned by other players. Land is dynamically added to the smart contract as the city becomes saturated. This ensures that all players have a greater chance to claim a salary than pay rent. New land is added at an exponentially higher price.

All properties including vacant lands can be exported to a NFT or traded on the in-game market."
