OIN Finance, The Gateway to DeFi. OIN will be the first DeFi platform to provide liquidity mining and loans on Ontology, and ultimately on other top platforms through cross-chain functionality. Our platform will build the bridge technology to seamlessly integrate Ethereum to start into our ecosystem, opening up to all of the current DeFi space. Cross-chain technology is crucial in DeFi and its growth as a legitimate financial infrastructure, after all, traditional finance also integrates the whole world, its currencies, and its different financial systems.
