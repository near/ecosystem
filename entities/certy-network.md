We aim to develop a Blockchain-powered application in educational certificate authentication (we upload certificates as NFTs), with the mission to eradicate the underlying issues of the existing certification system, which fueled the dominance of counterfeit documents. Furthermore, to utilize the abundance of extractable data, we also incorporate Artificial Intelligence in personalizing students’ learning pathway, as well as assisting them in career orientation. The expected outcome of our project is to create a forgery-free certification ecosystem that would greatly enhance the reputation of education institutions and employers’ recruitment of true talents, while most significantly, maximizing student’s employability and career readiness.
