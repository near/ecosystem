Defy Trends is building a robust and reliable analytics platform that includes both on- and off-chain analytics for coins and tokens across chains. For our beginner and intermediate users, our data insights are curated with the intention of showing actionable, digestible insights from non-biased data, while our pro subscribers enjoy a larger product suite. Our off-chain analytics include sentiment, news, and Github analysis while our on-chain analytics range from data on addresses, HODL metrics, and whale tracking to data on derivatives. The user is able to graph indicators from both on- and off-chain data on the same graph. This is presented on an intuitive and inviting UI, with a high focus on UX and educational components that support the user in understanding the various indicators and their context in the greater market or an investment strategy.
