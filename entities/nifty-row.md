Nifty Row NFT Marketplace for the unsung supports audio and visual arts including both digital art and contemporary fine art.  Nifty Row has a simple mission to empower the art community to leverage blockchain technology with DeFi to eliminate the issues of inadequate financially services, trust, authenticity and provenance of artwork while improving time to market.
