A DAO governed record label protocol enabling fans to fund artists in exchange for royalty rights. Artists will be able to fund their art via their 1,000 true fans, allowing them to create without compromise. Free-Artists aims to become a scalable, decentralized, permissionless, and transparent public utility, enhancing coordination and alignment of artists, fans and A&Rs.
