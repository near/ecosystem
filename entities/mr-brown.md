The heart of the project is mr. Brown himself, a lonely middle aged gentleman who worked his entire life as an insurance clerk. Every day, he wakes up at 6 am, drinks his double espresso shot, and leaves for work wearing the exact same outfit. There is absolutely nothing interesting happening in brown's day-to-day life, and we could probably end the story without even starting it, if not for the one peculiar detail about him. Brown has hundreds of imagined personalities living inside of his head. Every night he lays in his bed and lives through thousands of stories that happened with his alter-egos. We can now all dive into his imagination. 

The collection brings brown's identities into the Metaverse reality. It showcases incredible and eventful lives his alter egos are living through. The 4,200 hand-drawn portraits will present the range of mr. Brown identities from an eccentric and pretentious teenager to an approachable and chill senior. Each piece is a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) on the near protocol blockchain associated with a special moment of brown's fantastic virtual life.
