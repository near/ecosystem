IndexZoo is a cross-chain DeFi ecosystem of tokenized indices built for utmost accuracy, maximum leverage and lowest cost. Instead of using L1 spot market for index exposure, Zoo uses L2 DEX derivatives such as DyDx’s Perp contract, saving significantly gas fee for users and making rebalancing instantaneous. 

With Zoo’s flagship Bear Inverse Token and Fear Volatility Token, investors get the most diverse index exposures, most accurate performance tracking, and the lowest cost possible, enabling a comprehensive hedging and speculation solution with maximum stability and capital efficiency.
