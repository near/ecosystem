Atomic Wallet is a non-custodial decentralized wallet. It means that you own your backup phrase and private keys, thus, you fully control your funds. We have no access to your wallet and your sensitive information. Your 12-words backup and private keys are stored locally on your device and strongly encrypted. Moreover, your funds are not located in the wallet itself, there are safely stored on the blockchain. Atomic Wallet connects directly to the blockchain nodes and shows the information about your balances, transaction history and everything you see in the wallet. It also allows you to perform transactions on the blockchain. Atomic Wallet also provides you with exchange and buying crypto services with the help of our partners.
