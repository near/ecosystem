Amaterasu Finance is a native DEX on the Aurora chain. The governance token of the protocol is IZANAGI (ticker: $IZA)

Our goal is to be the leading DEX on Aurora and attain a high TVL, ultimately growing the Aurora ecosystem as a whole. The DEX will be the starting point but the team wants to expand the protocol. A few developments being considered are:

- Vaults
- Bonds
- And much more!

The concept of Amaterasu Finance comes from Japanese lore. Amaterasu is the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology and Izanagi is also one of the most important Japanese deities. Most of the Amaterasu Finance ecosystem branding takes inspiration from Japanese lore/history.
