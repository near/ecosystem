"We are Solving the Following Problem:
A recent study by the SEC of forex traders found 70% of traders lose money every quarter on average, and traders typically lose 100% of their money within 12 months — retail crypto investors & traders have similar results if not worse.

On 3 to 4 December 2021, according to BitInfoCharts, a trader had $16.29 billion worth of Bitcoin on Friday. On Saturday morning, the crypto market plummeted, dropping his/her/their crypto-assets worth $15.45 billion and then to $13.81 billion by the evening. The fall ultimately wiped out $2.48 billion for this trader in one day.

If any investor or trader had used our system, their market positions in their crypto asset Portfolio would have been sold into a stable coin on November 22, 2021 when our algorithmic system triggered an important market top sell signal, avoiding exacerbated losses.

Our Solution:
A Passive Investment System for investors & traders that want gains without most of the drawbacks of speculating. 
A One-Click — Automated Metaverse + GameFi ETP & Risk Management System for Investors without Time or Know-How.

GRAYLL will provide a simple to use start & stop system, for investors that are interested in Metaverse + GameFi token investments, which saves them time, avoids stress and biased decision making."
