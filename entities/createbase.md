Createbase is a NEAR guild that works to support projects/teams that are planning on building on Mintbase/NEAR.

Mintbase.io allows users to create their own NFT “store/factory” on the blockchain. From there, the possibilities are almost limitless. We are just here to help get us a little closer to that limit.
