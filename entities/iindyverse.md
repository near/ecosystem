"iiNDYVERSE is the first fully autonomous direct-to-fan growth engine for the Web 3 economy. Our platform enables any creator to directly capture and use first party fan data to mobilise their fan base to adopt new services at scale. All with no extra work required for the creator.

This Project aims to connect Web 2 audiences with Web 3 applications in the NEAR
ecosystem. Using first party data, co-owned by creator and us, iiNDY's will use its ML and
fan engagement capabilities to understand, influence and incentivise loyal fans to
adopt services powered by the NEAR protocol."
