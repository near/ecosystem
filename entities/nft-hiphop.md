<b>About NFT.HipHop</b>

NEAR collaborated with Ed Young, co-founder of The Source magazine, and artist André LeRoy Davis to release a collection of non-fungible tokens featuring portraits of iconic figures from the 47-year history of hip-hop.

The pop-up auction features new daily editions of all 103 Hip Hop Heads. Fans can bid with a credit card – no complex crypto onboarding – creating a NEAR account in the process, and the winners' NFTs will display in their NEAR wallet.
