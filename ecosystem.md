This repository is the data source for the community-sourced, core team curated NEAR Ecosystem page.

**You can also use [this form](https://nearprotocol1001.typeform.com/submit-project) to submit a project to this database.**

Our aim is to curate an accurate, up-to-date database of all entities in the NEAR ecosystem. Therefore, we have made this an open, community-driven repo which anyone can contribute to.

This is a living, breathing document and repo that will evolve over time as the community helps to maintain the map going forward.

# How To Contribute & Guidelines

We want to ensure the submission process captures as much information as possible pertaining to the entities added, while also remaining straightforward to contribute. 

All submissions to the NEAR Ecosystem are composed of two files: a Markdown file (.md), and a .svg or .png image. 

Adding a new entity to the ecosystem page only consists of two simple steps:
1. Create both a new markdown file in the `entities` directory with headers pertaining to each data field, and a detailed description of the entity outside the table
2. Add a new .svg or .png logo image in the `img` directory. (To upload a .png logo - 1. Fork  2. Upload  3. Create PR)


<b>Logo Submission Guidelines</b>

All .svg/.png files must be 100x100px. Do not embed any excessive raster image files: svg file sizes over 500kb will be rejected.
