Krisullis from the Greek word Khrusalis is that space fro the caterpillar that goes into the cocoon to transform into a butterfly. We believe that this environment is critical and valuable for growth. This is the space we are nurturing for community - a safe, encouraging self-paced learning environment - to foster peer connections, self growth and socio-economic based-impact towards a deep feeling of community-based joyful resourcefulness and thriving.
