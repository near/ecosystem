Collab.Land leverages the power of identity through crypto currency to create a social space unique to a specific network of humans.

Once you add the bot to your Telegram group or Discord guild, they will manage your people for you. Depending on their token holdings they will be allowed to join the community. If they sell, the bot boots them.
