3XR is connecting the spatial web with digital tokens, just like web pages connected the web, by innovating at the intersection of Web3 and WebXR by building products that enable the creation of spaces with direct access to digital economies via Web3 primitives (non-fungible and fungible tokens and decentralized autonomous organization).
