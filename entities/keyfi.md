We offer intelligent tools such as multi-wallet asset tracking, custom strategy builders, yield projection, portfolio tracking, and a powerful research dashboard. We seek to solve DeFi user challenges such as juggling multiple wallets/platforms/chains, manually comparing yield and the lack of historical data. The KEYFI token can be staked to earn rewards, used for governance proposals, and to gain access to our KeyFi Pro app.
