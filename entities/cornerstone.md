Cornerstone aims at becoming the most widely used metagovernance protocol across Web3, with an initial focus on the NEAR ecosystem. There are many governance tokens for DeFi, social, and NFT protocols in the Cornerstone treasury that enables users to participate in the governance of multiple Dapp protocols. If we view the DAO of a single protocol as the parliament of a country, then the Cornerstone DAO is more like the United Nations that formulates international rules to promote cross border collaboration.
