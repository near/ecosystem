Arroz Estúdios association is a non-profit organisation based in Beato, Lisbon.

We provide working space for emerging artists, and event spaces for them to showcase their work. Our goal is to offer a space for artistic growth where cultural events take place to contribute to Lisbon’s rapid development in a creative, open and multi-cultural way.
We work with both local and international artists engaging the local communities and giving international links.
