"DRRT Record Club will give collectors a closer connection to emerging music artists, each collectible (created originally by artists and designers) grants access to bonus hidden content and fosters a greater connection between artists and fans. DRRT will also be launching a DAO focussed at creating a fairer Web3 record label model for music artists."
